## RECOVERY MODULES FOR THE CHIMERIC READS

### BLAST
#### Dependencies: Python packages: Biopython, pandas

To apply the BLAST module to the chimeric queries, the *BLASTn.sh* module must run first on them; later, the *BLAST_recovery.py* module can rescue the nonchimeric reads. The module can be run by the command below specifying the directories related to each output:

```bash
python BLAST_recovery.py --chimeras_dir ./chimeras --blast_output_dir ./blast_output --nonchimeric_dir .
```

### ReChime
Please read the ReChime_RUNME.txt file for the instructions in the **ReChime_v1.zip** file before running the ReChime module. 


# 🧬 BlasCh recovery module for recovering False positive chimeras 

[![Python Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.6%2B-blue)](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Efficient chimera detection for long-read sequencing data using multiprocessing.

## 🚀 Features

- **Multiprocessing**: Blazing fast processing of multiple BLAST XML files
- **Resource Monitoring**: Tracks CPU and memory usage for optimization
- **Detailed Reporting**: Generates comprehensive overall and per-file statistics
- **Adaptive Performance**: Automatically utilizes all available CPU cores
- **Robust Error Handling**: Implements logging for seamless debugging


## 🏃‍♂️ Usage

1. Place your input FASTA files in the `./input` directory
2. Ensure BLAST XML result files are in the current directory
3. Run the script:
   ```
   python BlasCh.py
   ```
4. Find results in the `./rescued_reads` directory

## ⚙ Configuration

Modify these variables at the script's beginning to customize behavior:

```python
HIGH_IDENTITY_THRESHOLD = 99.0
HIGH_COVERAGE_THRESHOLD = 99.0
SIGNIFICANT_COVERAGE_THRESHOLD = 80.0
SIGNIFICANT_IDENTITY_THRESHOLD = 80.0
```
# BLAST Alignment Thresholds Explanation

The script uses two sets of thresholds to categorize BLAST alignments:

1. High Identity Thresholds:
   - Identity >= 99% and Coverage >= 99%

2. Significant Alignments Thresholds:
   - Coverage >= 80% and Identity >= 80%

## Why Two Sets of Thresholds?

These two sets of thresholds serve different purposes in the chimera detection process:

1. High Identity Thresholds (99%/99%):
   - Purpose: To identify nearly perfect matches.
   - Interpretation: Alignments meeting these criteria suggest that the query sequence is almost identical to a known sequence in the database.
   - Use in classification: Used to detect potential false positive chimeras or uncertain chimeras.

2. Significant Alignments Thresholds (80%/80%):
   - Purpose: To identify meaningful, but not necessarily perfect, matches.
   - Interpretation: Alignments meeting these criteria suggest that a substantial portion of the query sequence is similar to a known sequence, but allows for some differences.
   - Use in classification: Used to detect potential absolute chimeras or uncertain chimeras.

## How the Thresholds Work

For each alignment in the BLAST results:

1. Calculate query coverage: (alignment length / query sequence length) * 100
2. Calculate identity percentage: (number of identical matches / alignment length) * 100
3. Compare these values to the thresholds:
   - If both values meet or exceed the high identity thresholds (99%/99%), categorize as a "high identity" alignment.
   - If both values meet or exceed the significant alignment thresholds (80%/80%), but don't meet the high identity thresholds, categorize as a "significant" alignment.
   - If neither set of thresholds is met, the alignment is not considered further in the chimera classification process.

## Impact on Classification

- Sequences with one or more high identity alignments are classified as either false positive chimeras or uncertain chimeras, depending on whether the alignments are to different species.
- Sequences with multiple significant alignments (but no high identity alignments) are classified as absolute chimeras.
- Sequences with only one significant alignment are classified as uncertain chimeras.
- Sequences with no high identity or significant alignments are classified as non-chimeric.

This two-tiered approach allows the script to distinguish between nearly identical matches and merely significant matches, providing a more nuanced classification of potential chimeric sequences.
