Count: There are 254 sequences in the dataset.
Mean: The average length of the sequences is approximately 371, and the average breakpoint is about 257.
Standard deviation (std): The standard deviation, a measure of how spread out the numbers in a data set are, is approximately 67.25 for length and 154.13 for breakpoints. 
This means that the lengths and breakpoints of the sequences vary quite a bit.
Min: The shortest sequence length is 267, and the smallest breakpoint is 1.
25% (1st quartile): 25% of the sequences have a length of 326 or less, and 25% have a breakpoint of 118.25 or less.
50% (median): The median sequence length is 361.5, and the median breakpoint is 305.5.
75% (3rd quartile): 75% of the sequences have a length of 399.75 or less, and 75% have a breakpoint of 362.75 or less.
Max: The longest sequence is 682, and the largest breakpoint is also 682.


In the dataset:

158 sequences are not reversed.
96 sequences are reversed.
So, the sequences are more often not reversed than reversed.

The second most common file is Arcticomyces.full_and_partial.fasta, which appears 7 times.
The third most common files are Microbotryum.full_and_partial.fasta, Olpidium.full_and_partial.fasta, and Solicoccozyma.full_and_partial.fasta each appearing 6 times.



**Most of the sequences have lengths between approximately 300 and 400. There are fewer sequences with lengths outside this range. 
The distribution is somewhat right-skewed, meaning there are a few sequences with significantly longer lengths.**
