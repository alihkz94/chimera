Count: There are 254 sequences in the dataset.
Mean: The average length of the sequences is approximately 371, and the average breakpoint is about 257.
Standard deviation (std): The standard deviation, a measure of how spread out the numbers in a data set are, is approximately 67.25 for length and 154.13 for breakpoints. 
This means that the lengths and breakpoints of the sequences vary quite a bit.
Min: The shortest sequence length is 267, and the smallest breakpoint is 1.
25% (1st quartile): 25% of the sequences have a length of 326 or less, and 25% have a breakpoint of 118.25 or less.
50% (median): The median sequence length is 361.5, and the median breakpoint is 305.5.
75% (3rd quartile): 75% of the sequences have a length of 399.75 or less, and 75% have a breakpoint of 362.75 or less.
Max: The longest sequence is 682, and the largest breakpoint is also 682.

**Most of the sequences have lengths between approximately 300 and 400. There are fewer sequences with lengths outside this range. The distribution is somewhat right-skewed, 
meaning there are a few sequences with significantly longer lengths.**
