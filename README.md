# Data and scripts for "Enhancing long-read amplicon sequencing: Overcoming chimeric sequence challenges in biodiversity studies with VSEARCH and DADA2" (Hakimzadeh et al. 2024)

### Structure
This repository contains the data and part of the analysis stack for the abovementioned paper. It is structured as follows:

[BlasCh](https://github.com/alihkz94/long-chimeric-reads-project/tree/main/BlasCh) contain the BLAST scripts for alignment and specific module **BlasCh** designed for processing XML outputs to find false positive chimeras and false negative chimeras.

[Real data](https://github.com/alihkz94/long-chimeric-reads-project/tree/main/Real%20data) holds scripts related to the real data analysis.

[Simulated data](https://github.com/alihkz94/long-chimeric-reads-project/tree/main/Simulated%20data) holds scripts related to simulated dataset from generating the simulated data, chimeric sequence creation, quality filtering and chimera filtering related to the simulated dataset. Moreover the scripts for the simulated dataset and statical analysis for calculating F1 score.
